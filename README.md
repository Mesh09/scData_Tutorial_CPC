The data set that will be used in this Tutorial was generated in [Angelidis et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08831-9). To speed things up, we will use a smaller subset of cells, so do not worry if the results are not exactly as in the publication.

Here you find the Assignment for the single-cell Tutorial. Click on the "launch binder" button to start your first analysis in a custom computing environment! We use binder here, so that you do not need to worry about installing python locally and all the packages that we would need during the analysis.
